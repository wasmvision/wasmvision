# wasmVision Development

Do you want to try out the latest development builds, or work on developing wasmVision itself? If so, this is the place for information.

However, if what you want to do is develop a wasmVision processing module, please see the [PROCESSOR.md document](./PROCESSOR.md).

## Latest builds

### Linux

You can download the latest development builds for Linux by looking under [Linux workflows](https://github.com/wasmvision/wasmvision/actions/workflows/linux.yml) then clicking on the latest one you want to test. 

Under the "Artifacts" click on the link for either "wasmvision-linux-amd64" or "wasmvision-linux-arm64" depending on your processor to download it.

Extract the file to the desired test directory.

### macOS

You can download the latest development builds for macOs by looking under [macOS workflows](https://github.com/wasmvision/wasmvision/actions/workflows/macos.yml) then clicking on the latest one you want to test. 

Under the "Artifacts" click on the link for "wasmvision-macos-arm64" to download it.

Extract the file to the desired test directory.

### Windows

You can download the latest development builds for Linux by looking under [Linux workflows](https://github.com/wasmvision/wasmvision/actions/workflows/linux.yml) then clicking on the latest one you want to test. 

Under the "Artifacts" click on the link for "wasmvision-windows-amd64" to download it.

NOTE: you will likely need to configure your Windows Defender to download the ZIP file with the `wasmvision.exe` executable.

Extract the executable to your desired directory.

### Docker

You can run the latest development builds of wasmVision using Docker.

Pull the current development version:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/wasmvision/wasmvision:main
```

Run your desired docker commands using the tagged image `ghcr.io/wasmvision/wasmvision:main` (NOT `ghcr.io/wasmvision/wasmvision:latest` which is the latest released version).

## Local development

If you have a local installation of both Go and OpenCV you can install wasmVision directly:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wasmvision/wasmvision.git
cd wasmvision
go install ./cmd/wasmvision/
```

And run it:

```shell
wasmvision run -p ./processors/hello.wasm -mjpeg=true


You can run wasmVision using Docker.

Pull the current development version:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/wasmvision/wasmvision:main
```
