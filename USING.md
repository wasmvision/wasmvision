### Automatically download the `blur` processor, capture from your webcam (default), process the video, and stream the output using MJPEG to port 8080 (default)

```shell
wasmvision run -p blur
```

### Automatically download the `mosaic` processor and the `mosaic-9.onnx` model, capture from your webcam (default), process the video, and stream the output using MJPEG to port 8080 (default)

```shell
wasmvision run -p mosaic
```

### Capture from your webcam (default), process the video using the `mosaic.wasm` processor located in the default processor directory, and stream the output using MJPEG to port 8080 (default)

```shell
wasmvision run -p mosaic.wasm
```

### Capture from your webcam (default), process the video using the `yourcustom.wasm` processor located in a non-default directory, and stream the output using MJPEG to port 8080 (default)

```shell
wasmvision run -p /path/to/processors/yourcustom.wasm
```

### Capture from a secondary webcam, process the video, and stream the output using MJPEG to port 8080 (default)

```shell
wasmvision run -s /dev/video2 -p /path/to/processors/mosaic.wasm
```

### Capture from your webcam (default), process the video using 2 processors chained together, and stream the output using MJPEG to port 8080 (default)

```shell
wasmvision run -p /path/to/processors/hello.wasm -p /path/to/processors/mosaic.wasm
```

### Capture from a file, process the video, and stream the output using MJPEG to port 6000

```shell
wasmvision run -s /path/to/video/filename.mp4 -p /path/to/processors/blur.wasm -o mjpeg -d :6000
```

### Capture from your webcam, process the video, and save the output to a file

```shell
wasmvision run -p /path/to/processors/mosaic.wasm -o file -d /path/to/video/filename.avi
```
