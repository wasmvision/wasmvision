# wasmVision Capture Sources

You can capture video data from a webcam, from data files, or from a stream. wasmVision has built-in support for [FFmpeg]](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) on Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. wasmVision also includes built-in support for [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) on Linux systems.

## Webcam

Your webcam will probably "just work" on Linux, macOS, or Windows. However, you might need to determine the correct identifier to use. Very typically the ID of "0" is the default camera.

## FFMpeg

FFMpeg is very useful to read data from files and streams of different formats. More info about the installed capabilities will go here soon.
